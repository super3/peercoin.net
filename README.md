Peercoin.net Repo
============
The static html files for [Peercoin.net](http://peercoin.net). The website is automatically updated from this repo every 10 minutes, so be careful with any commits to the `master` branch.


### Issues
Content requests, bugs, etc. are all handled through [Github Issues](https://github.com/super3/Peercoin.net/issues). We will try to get to your issue as soon as possible.

### Pull Requests
If you have a simple change to the website, we ask that you put in a pull request instead of an issue. These include things like link changes, text errors, etc. We can add these to the live site just by accepting the pull, which makes everything easier. We are currently using [Tip4Commit](http://tip4commit.com/projects/222) and [Peer4Commit](http://peer4commit.com/projects/2) to reward commiters. Fluff commits will be rejected.

If don't know how to submit a pull request use these helpful guides: [one](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and [two](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/). 

### Translations
Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Peercoin.net's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/website-ppc/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository.

Important: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

### Installing and Running
Below are just some notes for running the website yourself. We run the website on a simple [Apache2](https://httpd.apache.org/) server with [PHP5](http://php.net/) installed.

### Deploy
URL Rewriting via Apache's ```mod_rewrite``` module has issues when the ```MultiViews``` [option](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options) is set in any of the config files in the ```sites-available``` directory. Ensure this option is removed from your site's config files or errors will occur with URL rewriting (```/mining.php -> /mining```)

We run the deploy.sh every 10 minutes, so that the live site is always up to date. This also calls the market ticker updater. The cron job
is listed below:

	*/10 * * * * /root/deploy.sh > /root/error.txt 2>&1

The script(deploy.sh):

    #!/bin/bash

	# Install - Only Run Once
	# git clone https://github.com/super3/peercoin.net.git /var/www
	
	# Update
	cd /var/www/
	git fetch origin
	git reset --hard origin/master
	
	# Update Ticker
	php /var/www/update_tickerinfo.php


### Market Ticker
The ticker sources data from CoinMarketCap, and if that fails, falls back to the Vircurex API. `tickerinfo.php` returns a JSON array containing the last price, market capitalization, and total number of PPC in circulation.

Ensure that `ppcmarket.txt` is writeable by the PHP user so that the ticker can store updated information. Running `update_tickerinfo.php` will update the info provided by the ticker. This should be run via cron.
