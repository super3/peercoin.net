				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>
					Peercoin is a hybrid Proof-Of-Work / Proof-Of-Stake coin that uses the same proof-of-work algorithm as Bitcoin. This means you can mine Peercoin with GPUs, FGPAs and ASICs using Bitcoin mining software.
					Through Peercoin's increasing popularity, the transition to proof-of-stake, and the decreasing return on mining, competition for blocks becomes more fierce.

				<p>
					Even with powerful hardware it is difficult to mine alone.	Mining pools combine the power of all participants to find blocks, and share the reward proportionally based on shares. These guides
					show you how to poolmine at some of the largest PPC pools. Also make sure to take a look at our <a href="/minting">Minting Guide</a>, as you can also earn up 1% on top of your mining rewards.
