          <p>
            Peercoin is a Proof-Of-Work/Proof of Stake hybrid coin that is compatible with the same ASIC hardware used on the Bitcoin network. Initially the ratio of newly produced coins favored mined coins over minted coins.  However over time as more coins are generated, the ratio of newly produced coins shifts to favor ones produced via Proof-Of-Stake minting. With this, the increasing popularity of Peercoin, increasing minting rate, and the decreasing return on mining, competition for blocks becomes fiercer.
            Even with powerful hardware it is difficult to mine alone.	Mining pools combine the power of all participants to find blocks and share the reward based on shares. Read the instructions of each pool carefully as connection protocols and software use can change between pools.
